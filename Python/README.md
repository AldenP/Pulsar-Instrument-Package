The most current program for reading data over the UART-USB bridge from the ESP32 is `serialMonitor.py.` 
Data will be saved after a sample is collected, and then plotted on the spot. 

`pythonEnvironment.txt` contains the output of the command `pip freeze`, allowing others to setup the same virtual environment for running the Python code.
