# Pulsar-Instrument-Package
Software Package for calculating the polarization and pulse timing of pulsars from data collected in the .FITS format.
Also includes the programming for the Embedded MSP430 board.
Part of a Senior Design Project at UCF during the Summer 2024 and Fall 2024 semesters.

## List of Functionality
The following lists the basic functionality that the package provides:
- Takes data in the .FITS format and extracts it into a python-usable form
- Takes extracted data and calculates the Pulse Timing of a Pulsar
- Takes extracted data and calculates the Polarization of a Pulsar

On the embedded side:
- Handle User input via physical buttons
- Adjust the sampling rate, and sample duration based on user input
- Output data collected via USB/UART to a connected PC
